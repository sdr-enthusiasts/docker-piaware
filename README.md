FlightAware's PiAware docker container including support for RTL-SDR, bladeRF and others. Includes `dump1090` and `dump978`.

Builds and runs on `linux/amd64`, `linux/386`, `linux/arm/v7` and `linux/arm64`.

For more information on what PiAware is, see here: [FlightAware - PiAware](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/).

This container can operate in "net only" mode and pull ADS-B Mode-S & UAT data from another host/container. **This is the recommended way of deploying the container**, and I'd humbly suggest [`mikenye/readsb-protobuf`](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-readsb-protobuf) and [`mikenye/dump978`](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-dump978) (if you live in an area that uses UAT).

*Note:* `bladerf`/`hackrf`/`limesdr`/`radarcape` - Support for these is compiled in, but I need to complete the wrapper/helper scripts. I don't have access to these devices. If you do, and would be willing to test, please get in touch with me!

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` should always contain the latest released version of piaware and support tools. This image is built nightly from the [`master` branch](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-piaware/tree/master) [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-piaware/blob/master/Dockerfile) for all supported architectures.
* Specific version and architecture tags are available if required, however these are not regularly updated. It is generally recommended to run `latest`.
* There are also `latest` and version-specific tags appended with `_nohealthcheck` where the container healthchecks have been excluded from the image build. See [issue #43](https://github.com/mikenye/docker-piaware/issues/43).

## Contributors

* Thanks to [Jan Collijs](https://github.com/visibilityspots) for contributing to the 3.7.1, 3.7.2 and 3.8.0 releases.
* Thanks to [ShoGinn](https://github.com/ShoGinn) for many contributions to the 3.8.0 release and tidy up of code & readme.
* Thanks to [ssbb](https://flightaware.com/adsb/stats/user/pmd5700#stats-134107) for allowing me to use his Pi as a development platform for UAT support.

## Multi Architecture Support

Currently, this image should pull and run on the following architectures:

* `linux/i386`
* `linux/amd64`
* `linux/arm/v7`
* `linux/arm64`

In order to ensure `dump1090` is optimised for the hardware running it, the `dump1090` binary is built on first-run of the container.

## Prerequisites

If using an RTL-SDR, before this container will work properly, you must blacklist the kernel modules for the RTL-SDR USB device from the host's kernel.

To do this, create a file `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-rtl2832.conf` containing the following:

```shell
# Blacklist RTL2832 so docker container piaware can use the device

blacklist rtl2832
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
blacklist rtl2832_sdr
```

Once this is done, you can plug in your RTL-SDR USB device and start the container.

Failure to do this will result in the error below being spammed to the container log.

```text
2019-04-29 21:14:31.642500500  [dump1090-fa] Kernel driver is active, or device is claimed by second instance of librtlsdr.
2019-04-29 21:14:31.642635500  [dump1090-fa] In the first case, please either detach or blacklist the kernel module
2019-04-29 21:14:31.642663500  [dump1090-fa] (dvb_usb_rtl28xxu), or enable automatic detaching at compile time.
2019-04-29 21:14:31.642677500  [dump1090-fa]
2019-04-29 21:14:31.642690500  [dump1090-fa] usb_claim_interface error -6
```

If you get the error above even after blacklisting the kernel modules as outlined above, the modules may still be loaded. You can unload them by running the following commands:

```shell
sudo rmmod rtl2832_sdr
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
sudo rmmod rtl2832
```

## Determining your Feeder ID

You need to specify a feeder-id for the container, as this is used by FlightAware to track your PiAware instance.

**Make sure you set your feeder ID via the `FEEDER_ID` environment variable. Failure to do this will cause a new FlightAware site ID to be generated every time you launch the container.**

### Already running PiAware

You'll need your *feeder-id* from your existing feeder.

To get your *feeder-id*, log onto your feeder and issue the command:

```shell
piaware-config -show feeder-id
```

### New to PiAware

You'll need a *feeder-id*. To get one, you can temporarily run the container, to allow it to communicate with the FlightAware servers and get a new feeder ID.

Run the commands:

```shell
docker pull mikenye/piaware:latest
timeout 30 docker run --rm -e LAT=YOURLATITUDE -e LONG=YOURLONGITUDE mikenye/piaware:latest | grep "my feeder ID"
```

Be sure to change the following:

* Replace `YOURLATITUDE` with the latitude of your antenna (xx.xxxxx)
* Replace `YOURLONGITUDE` with the longitude of your antenna (xx.xxxxx)

The command will run the container for 30 seconds, which should be ample time for the container to receive a feeder-id.

For example:

```shell
timeout 30 docker run --rm -e LAT=-33.33333 -e LONG=111.11111 mikenye/piaware:latest | grep "my feeder ID"
```

Will output:

```text
Set allow-mlat to yes in /etc/piaware.conf:1
Set allow-modeac to yes in /etc/piaware.conf:2
Set allow-auto-updates to no in /etc/piaware.conf:3
Set allow-manual-updates to no in /etc/piaware.conf:4
2020-03-06 06:16:11.860212500  [piaware] my feeder ID is acbf1f88-09a4-3a47-a4a0-10ae138d0c1g
write /dev/stdout: broken pipe
Terminated
```

As you can see from the output above, the feeder-id given to us from FlightAware is `acbf1f88-09a4-3a47-a4a0-10ae138d0c1g`.

You'll now want to "claim" this feeder.

To do this, go to: [FlightAware PiAware Claim](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/claim) and follow the instructions there.

## Deployment Examples

### Example `docker run` command with RTL-SDR USB for reception of 1090MHz

```shell
docker run \

      - RECEIVER_TYPE=rtlsdr
    tmpfs:
      - /run:exec,size=64M
      - /var/log
```

### Example `docker run` command with 2x RTL-SDR USB for reception of 1090MHz and 978MHz

This will currently only work in the United States of America, as they are the only country that uses ADS-B UAT on 978MHz.

This example assumes that:

* Your 1090MHz RTL-SDR has its serial set to `00001090`
* Your 978MHz RTL-SDR has its serial set to `00000978`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name piaware \
 --device /dev/bus/usb \
 -e TZ="Australia/Perth" \
 -e LAT=-33.33333 \
 -e LONG=111.11111 \
 -e RECEIVER_TYPE=rtlsdr \
 -e DUMP1090_DEVICE=00001090 \
 -e UAT_RECEIVER_TYPE=rtlsdr \
 -e DUMP978_DEVICE=00000978 \
 -e FEEDER_ID=c478b1c99-23d3-4376-1f82-47352a28cg37 \
 -p 8080:80 \
 --tmpfs=/run:exec,size=64M \
 --tmpfs=/var/log \

In the example below, it is assumed that the external BEAST provider resolves to `beasthost` and is listening for connections on TCP port `30005`.

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name piaware \
 -e TZ="Australia/Perth" \
 -e LAT=-33.33333 \
